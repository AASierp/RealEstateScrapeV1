# RealEstateScrapeV1

This program scrapes real estate data from a local (Kentucky) real estate agency and displays the results in the console. 
It is tuned to only return the 10 most recent listing for a predetermined set of counties.
I chose to only return the ten most recent listings because it is very rare, in the current market, to see more than that
listed in a single day in the given area.

I wrote the application to save myself time. While house hunting, I was having to visit a listing website, search by each county and then filter by most recent listings.
I was having to do this multiple times a day to keep up with the most recent activity. This application allows me to get the desired information with a single click.
